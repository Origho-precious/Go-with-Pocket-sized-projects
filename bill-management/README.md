### Module: bill-management

This a basic Go program from the [The netninja Go Crash course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gC88BEo9czgyS72A3doDeM). It is a simple program that takes a list of bills and tip from the command line, calculates the total and can save it to file.

I added some tests and some improvements.
